{
    Actual DOM: {
        Reality: The actual DOM represents the web page's structure as it exists
        in the browser. It's a tree-like structure where each element
        in the page is a node.
    }
    1- {
        Manipulation: Directly manipulating the actual DOM can be slow and
        inefficient because every change triggers a reflow and repaint, which can
        be expensive in terms of performance.
    }
    2- {
        Synchronization: Keeping the actual DOM in sync with the application
        state can be challenging and error-prone, especially in large and complex
        applications.
    }
    3- {
        Interactivity: The actual DOM is what users interact with when they use your web
        application. It's responsible for rendering the content, handling events,
        and updating the UI in response to user actions.

    Virtual DOM {
        In React, the Virtual DOM (Virtual Document Object Model) and the actual
        DOM (Document Object Model) are two key concepts that play a crucial role
        in optimizing and efficiently updating the user interface.
    }
    1- {
        Abstraction: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy or representation
        of the actual DOM. It's a JavaScript object tree that mirrors the structure 
        of the real DOM.

    }
    2- {
        Reconciliation: React uses the Virtual DOM to efficiently update
        the user interface. When there's a change in the application state,
        React creates a new Virtual DOM tree, compares it with the previous one, 
        and calculates the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM.
    }
    3- {
        Performance: Since the Virtual DOM is just a JavaScript object,
        manipulating it is faster than manipulating the actual DOM.
        React can make changes to the Virtual DOM more efficiently,
        reducing the number of direct manipulations of the real DOM,
        which is slower and more resource-intensive.
    }
    4- {
        Batching: React batches multiple changes together and applies them
        to the real DOM in a single update, which minimizes layout
        thrashing and enhances performance.
    }
    {
        In summary, the main difference is that the Virtual DOM is an abstraction
        or a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM
        to optimize updates by reducing the frequency of direct changes to the real
        DOM, making applications more efficient and responsive. React's
        reconciliation process, which calculates the minimal set of changes
        required to update the real DOM, is a key part of this optimization.

{
    DOM Portals {
        DOM portal is a technique that allows you to render a component's 
        content at a different location in the HTML DOM tree than where it 
        would normally be placed within the component hierarchy.
        This is often used for implementing modal dialogs, popovers,
        tooltips, and other UI elements that need to "portal" outside
        their parent component's container.
        React provides a utility called ReactDOM.createPortal
        to facilitate this process. 
    }
}

{
    DOM Ref and useRef {
        In React, the ref attribute and the useRef hook are used to access and 
        interact with the DOM (Document Object Model) nodes or React elements 
        directly. They are particularly useful for managing focus, reading values
        from form elements, and interacting with third-party libraries or non-React
        code. Both ref and useRef allow you to create references to DOM elements
        or React components.
    }
}

{
    Controlled and Uncontrolled Components {
        1- {
            controlled components are the recommended approach in React 
            for most scenarios because they provide more control and predictability
            over form inputs.
        }
        2- {
            Uncontrolled components might be useful in cases where integrating
            with external libraries or non-React code is necessary, but they come 
            with limitations in terms of React's ability to manage and manipulate
            form values.
        }
    }
